Once pricing has been decided you’re ready to set up registration. Here are some basic guidelines.

* Use [Bevy](https://community.cncf.io/) for registration if your event is free. Alternatively, payment platforms should be discussed with CNCF and be able to include *opt-in* language for sharing attendee data with sponsors and CNCF. Also things to consider are badge scanning opportunities for on-site, and collection of attendee demographics for your transparency reports.
* Keep registration fees below 200 USD / 185 EU (free for virtual only events) - the lower the better to attract a more diverse group of attendees
* Sell tickets on a first-come/first-serve basis that is completely open to the public
* Offer “early bird” pricing (10% to 25% discount)  to drive initial registration
* Registration lists may NOT be used for commercial or marketing purposes
* Registration lists may NOT be shared with third parties or any organization not directly involved in organizing the event.  Please review the Kubernetes Community Privacy Policy Statement.
* Event organizers must add the following statement to the registration page:
  “Personal information gathered by the organizers is handled in accordance with the Foundation’s Privacy Policy and is used for internal purposes only."

[Here are reccomended registration form questions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OEoVQ8Y3eQmEEJeT2abhNOkYIkyk8nAVjebNFvKMTQQ/edit#gid=0) the CNCF uses for KubeCon. You will find some reccomendations to assist in gathering demographic information. You can find out how to add it to the registration process in [this article](https://help.bevylabs.com/article/386-editing-event-forms).


Here are some other ways you can improve the registration process.

* Ask for employer name (optional) if people want it printed on their badge
* Ask for a Twitter handle (optional) to help attendees connect with one another
* Ask for T-shirt sizes (make sure you offer more than S-M-L-XL “unisex”)
* Ask if they require an invoice and what information should be on the invoice
* Ask if they are interested in attending the evening event on the first night (optional)
* Set up hidden ticket types for sponsors, organizers, speakers, etc
* Create access codes for hidden ticket types

IMPORTANT: Attendee email or direct-contact information should never be visible on the website or given out to vendors UNLESS there is a directt opt-in for sponsor communications by the attendees via the registration form (not with a pre-marked box). See the above spreadsheet for an exmaple. We value privacy and anti-spam.
