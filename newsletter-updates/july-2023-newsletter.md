### Hello KCD Community! 
We are happy to announce the new changes coming to the process of collecting, creating and displaying the KCD Transparency Reports. 
In collaboration with CNCF, our team has been working hard to improve the user experience and make it even easier for the creation of comprehensive and informative transparency reports for your individual KCD events. We understand that you collectively work so hard to put together these amazing events for your communities and in short, these changes aim to streamline the data collection process, reinvigorate the design, and target the attendees, stakeholders and sponsors in ways in which put your events in the best possible spotlight.
**Please read on for all the new features and improvements:**
###  1. New Templates for Report Presentations

The previous ways of creating report pdfs was both tedious and disjointed. Our new templated solution combines consistency, professionalism and collaboration to create all individual Transparency Reports. [View the KCD Transparency Report Template](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFhDHqyNBw/H2uJJV_hDX7Ln_R_IGpWkg/edit?utm_content=DAFhDHqyNBw&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton). Some key highlights include:
- **Consistent & professional look**
With the use of a standardized template, each report will have a fresh and new look that is both professional and consistent, but also specially branded for each community through cover pages, logos and end slides.
- **User-friendly & streamlined**
Our new method will use Canva to easily create and collaborate on all individual Transparency Reports for your KCD events. For new users, the first page of the template serves as a quick How-To-Use Guide with a link to more in-depth support, if needed.
###  2. Post-Event Bevy Survey

A post-event survey in Bevy will now automatically get sent out to help assure your attendees can provide quotes and top sessions for your future transparency reports. So if you are using an external registration platform and you wish to collect the following data, be sure to reach out to Audra to do a bulk upload of your attendees to add them as members to your KCD chapter.
- Please provide us with your honest takeaways, thoughts, and overall review of the event you attended. (required question)
- What were some key takeaways from the speaker(s)/session(s) you attended? (required question)
- Which speaker(s)/session(s) were your favorite? (required question)
- Did you attend our event in-person or virtually, in person, or both? (optional question)
